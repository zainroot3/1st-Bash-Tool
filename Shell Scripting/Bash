When we run any command in terminal the command go to shell and then run it.
### What is Shell scripting actually is?
                                        Shell is the Command line interpretation
                                        When we run any command it goes to shell
                                        Then our shell perform tasks from operating system
                                        For example if we write ls on terminal
                                        Our terminal gives command to shell
                                        And shell gives the command to the kernal
                                        Then kernal list the directories and files in termina
                                        All things done on the terminal
                                        So, We can understand how task works by this basic text diagram
                                        Input:   Command -> Terminal -> Shell -> Kernal
                                        Output:  Kernal -> Shell -> Terminal -> Output
                                        Kernal is the brain of linux
### Shell Scripting in Pen Testing:
                                   Automation:
                                              We can automate repetive tasks using shell scripting
                                   Efficiency
                                   Accuracy
Shell is now updated to its many versions like bash and zsh languages but here we will learn bash
### Folder
            In folder we can store many folders files and anythings
### Files
            It is only one file that contain extension
